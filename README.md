## Usage
We have multiple files for inserts because we have too much data to insert in one SQL file because it will crash.
The file called book should be run first, until the point where it says insert using insert files.
The insert files should be run in this order:
1. book_table
2. author
3. genre
4. writes
5. has_genre
6. reader
7. booklist

Then the tests are in the book file and should be run after the inserts.
